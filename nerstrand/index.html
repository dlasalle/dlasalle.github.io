<h3>Nerstrand - Fast Multi-threaded Graph Clustering</h3>
<p>
Nerstrand is a multi-threaded multilevel graph clustering tool for generating
clusterings with high modularity. It supports both finding a specified number
of clusters/communities as well as detecting the number of
clusters/communities.
</p>

<b>Source Code</b>
<p>
The latest can be found on
<a href="https://github.com/dlasalle/nerstrand">GitHub</a>
</p>

<p>
Older version can be
<a href="releases">here</a>
</p>

<p>
Nerstrand is available under the 
<a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT license</a>.
</p>

<b>Building</b>
<p>
Building Nerstrand requires a C99 compiler supporting OpenMP specification 3.0 
or greater (almost all of my testing is with GCC) and CMake. The
<tt>configure</tt> script requires Bash, however it is possible to do the
configuration by hand.

To build Nerstrand with the default options, execute:
</p>
<p>
<tt>
./configure && make
</tt>
</p>
<p>
After it is built, the binary and the library will reside in
<tt>./build/[system-arch]/bin</tt> and <tt>./build/[system-arch]/lib</tt>
respectively (for most systems, <tt>[system-arch]</tt> will be
<tt>Linux-x86_64</tt>, but depends on your OS/architecture). Nerstrand can
the optionally be installed using <tt>make install</tt> (the default prefix is
<tt>/usr/local</tt>, but can be changed with 
<tt>configure --prefix="my_prefix"</tt>).
</p>

<b>Usage</b>
<p>
Nerstrand can then be used to cluster a graph as follows:
</p>
<p>
<tt>
nerstrand test.graph
</tt>
</p>
<p>
Most users will actually want the cluster assignment and not just runtime
statistics, and should append the name of the output file.</p>
<p>
<tt>
nerstrand test.graph test.cluster
</tt>
</p>
<p>
The Nerstrand binary currently only supports the 
<a href="glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/fetch/sw/metis/manual.pdf">Metis Graph
Format</a> for input.
</p>
<p>
Nerstrand currently has a large number of options, many of which are
experimental. For a complete list, use the <tt>-h</tt> option:
</p>
<p>
<tt>
nerstrand -h
</tt>
</p>
